# UART-RS422-Adapter

This is the schematic of UART-RS422 adapter I use to connect Chorus RF Laptimer device to a PC with Cat5 Ethernet cable.

There are 2 slightly different PCBs because pinout of regular Ethernet cable is the same on 2 ends, but I need a crossover schematic:

RJ45 pins 1, 2 Rx <= Tx RJ45 pins 1, 2

RJ46 pins 3, 6 Tx => Rx RJ45 pins 3, 6
